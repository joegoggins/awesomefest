== About
Awesomefest is Joe's web playground for some plugins he's workin on open sourcing.
* autocompleter_server
* autocompleter_client
* weighted_search

Everything in the app is namespaced with a V1, V2, etc to keep different experiments
separate from one another.

== Install
Assuming you have MySQL running on localhost with a user "root" with no password

git clone git@github.com:joegoggins/awesomefest.git

cd awesomefest

git submodule update --init

rake db:create

rake db:migrate

rake db:fixtures:load

script/server

hit localhost:3000 and type "donke", you should get an autocompleter suggestion.

If you can do this the app is up and working

== V1 Goals

This is the baseline, out of the box autocompleter untouched

# Make a document model to throw our stuff
#
script/generate scaffold V1::Documents created_by_user_id:integer owned_by_user_id:integer title:string keywords:string questions:text description:text body:text

# Make a user model
#
script/generate scaffold V1:Users name:string email:string


== V2 Goals
Build something mimimal on the front end in jQuery without touching the backend.

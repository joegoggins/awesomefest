== Cluster-ed Weighted Search with Autocompleters Concept
Clustering by resource type, aka Google Page, Wikipedia page, Facebook profile.
Search results weighted by variable weights on the various members for each resource type.
Auto-completion based on weighted_search scores
Visualization links shown for data that makes sense.

Assuming user types "birth", suggestions from the auto-completer come in the form of:
  - Resource Type				
    - Resource Link and Title (on "birthday")
      Visualize: 
    - Resource Link and Title (on "birthday blues")
    - Resource Link and Title (on "birth")  
  - Resource Type				
    - Resource Link and Title (on "ron's birthday")  
  - Resource Type				
    - Resource Link and Title (on "birthday calendar")
      Visualize: social 
    - Resource Link and Title   

On click of "Resource Type" it just simply goes to that source directly with the query
or a paginated list of results of only this Resource Type

On click of Resource Link it takes you to the page
When you press enter you go to the resource

The temporal social spacial graphical links appear if the item has data that would be appropriate 
to visualize in this way.

Resource Type Visualization ideas for a hypothetical IT organization:
  - Wiki Page: Incoming Links, Outgoing links, Authors, Tag cloud, Word distribution histogram
  - Knowledge Base Article

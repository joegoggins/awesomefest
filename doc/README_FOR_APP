== About
Awesomefest is Joe's web playground for some plugins he's workin on open sourcing.
* autocompleter_server
* autocompleter_client
* weighted_search

Everything in the app is namespaced with a V1, V2, etc to keep different experiments
separate from one another.

== V1 Goals
Radically trim down & optimize the existing auto-completer server.
Rebuild a minimal client on top of the new server with jQuery.

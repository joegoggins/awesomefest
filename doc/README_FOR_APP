== About
Awesomefest is a web play ground to show some Rails plugins in action starting with:
* autocompleter_server
* autocompleter_client
* weighted_search

Each demonstration of tools is called a round, the app is namespaced R1, R2, etc
to accomodate new experiments.

== To Run (assumes mysql)
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:fixtures:load
script/server

== Goals of Round 1.

Demonstrate weighted search + autocompleters + cool visualizations + clustered results
on whatever data is easiest to work with and most open.

Brainstorm on awesomefest round 1.

Goal is to build a super awesome autocompleter driven system that powers entire pages with aggregated content from many different sources starting with wikipedia and facebook.

The idea is to have the user fully immersed in various different intelligently clustered suggestions
with each keystroke typed into the autocompleter.

For example:
I type "bla" and get the top N results of for "bla" queries done in google, wikipedia, and facebook
with each entry any thing with temporal information gets rendered with simile timeline,
anything with geographic information gets rendered spatially on google maps,
social information gets visualized with moowheel,
a histogram is built of the word distribution on the target content

a list of incoming links is generated,
a list of outgoing links is generated
